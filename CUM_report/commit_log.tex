\title{Commit Summary Report (CUM Report)}
\author{Generated by Git Post-Commit Hook}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document contains summaries of commits, generated automatically after each commit. Each commit is a section, and each modified file within that commit is presented as a subsection with its AI-generated summary. Commit details are provided at the end of each section. If a file's diff is large, its summary might be generated from multiple parts.

\section{Introduction}
This document provides a log of commit summaries. Each main section corresponds to a single Git commit. Within each commit section, individual subsections detail the AI-generated summary for each modified file. Key details about the commit (hash, author, date) are listed at the end of each section's content.

\subsection{File: \texttt{CUM\_report/commit\_log.tex}}\n{\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont\n  The code changes in this commit add several new packages and features to the document class. These changes include:

* The `article` class for formatting the document.
* The `inputenc` package for encoding the document in UTF--8.
* The `parskip` package for adding extra spacing between paragraphs.
* The `hyperref` package for adding links to the document.
* The `fontenc` package for specifying the font encoding.
* The `lmodern` package for the Latin Modern font.
* The `amsmath` package for mathematical typesetting.
* The `xcolor` package for colored text.
* The `courier` package for the PCR font family.
* The `xurl` package for better URL handling.
* The `minted` package for syntax highlighting (optional but good for code diffs).
* The `geometry` package for page layout, with the `a4paper` and `margin=1in` options specified.

The changes also add several new commands, including `\textbackslash\{\}documentclass`, `\textbackslash\{\}usepackage`, `\textbackslash\{\}title`, `\textbackslash\{\}author`, `\textbackslash\{\}date`, `\textbackslash\{\}maketitle`, `\textbackslash\{\}begin\{abstract\}`, `\textbackslash\{\}end\{abstract\}`, `\textbackslash\{\}tableofcontents`, `\textbackslash\{\}newpage`, `\textbackslash\{\}section`, and `\textbackslash\{\}end\{document\}`.

The overall purpose of these changes is to add structure and formatting to the document, including a table of contents, a title page, and a section for each commit. The document also includes a summary of each modified file within a commit, as well as details about the commit (hash, author, date).\n}\n\n\subsection{File: \texttt{cum\_installer.sh}}\n{\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont\n\{\textbackslash\{\}bfseries Summary for Diff Part 1 of 3:\}\textbackslash\{\}par\textbackslash\{\}n  This is the first part of a three--part diff for a script called "cum\_installer.sh". The script is used to install and set up a tool called "CUM Report" (Commit Summary Report), which is a tool that generates a summary of each commit made to a Git repository. The script is triggered by a post--commit hook, which is a Git feature that allows for custom actions to be performed after each commit.

The script starts by checking if it is being run inside a Git repository, and if not, it exits with an error message. It then checks if the required packages (jq and curl) are installed, and if not, it attempts to install them.

The script then defines a function called "install\_package" that is used to install packages if they are missing. This function checks if the package is installed, and if not, it attempts to install it using the package manager (apt--get, yum, or brew) that is available on the system. If the package cannot be installed, the script exits with an error message.

The script then creates a directory called "CUM\_report" in the root directory of the Git repository, and creates an initial LaTeX file called "commit\_log.tex" in this directory. The LaTeX file is used to generate the summary of each commit.

The script then defines a post--commit hook that is triggered by Git after each commit. This hook runs the "cum\_post\_commit\_hook.sh" script, which is responsible for generating the summary of each commit. The hook is installed in the ".git/hooks" directory of the Git repository.

Overall, the script is responsible for installing and setting up the CUM Report tool, which is a tool that generates a summary of each commit made to a Git repository. The tool is triggered by a post--commit hook, and it uses the required packages (jq and curl) to communicate with a Language Model (LLM) API to generate the summary of each commit.\textbackslash\{\}n\textbackslash\{\}n\{\textbackslash\{\}bfseries Summary for Diff Part 2 of 3:\}\textbackslash\{\}par\textbackslash\{\}n' or similar) to get the PDF report."

+echo "\textbackslash\{\}n\textbackslash\{\}n\{\textbackslash\{\}bfseries Summary for Diff Part 3 of 3:\}\textbackslash\{\}par\textbackslash\{\}n  The final part of the diff file contains a script that is intended to be run as a hook after a `git commit` command. The script performs several actions:

1. Runs the `pdflatex` command twice to generate a PDF report in the `\$CUM\_REPORT\_DIR` directory.
2. Prints a message to the console indicating that the hook has run and to run `pdflatex` twice for the table of contents and cross--references to be correct.
3. Prints a message to the console indicating that the script has finished running and the current date and time.

The purpose of this script is likely to generate a PDF report after each `git commit` command. The report is generated using the `pdflatex` command, and the script is intended to be run as a hook to automate this process.

The potential impact of this script is that it allows developers to easily generate a PDF report after each commit, which can be useful for tracking changes to the codebase over time. The script also provides a convenient way to ensure that the report is generated correctly and that the table of contents and cross--references are up--to--date.\textbackslash\{\}n\textbackslash\{\}n\n}\n\n
